# 🛠️ Storm-Framework Contribution Guide

Hello! Thank you for your interest in enlarging **Storm-Framework**. This project is a project *open-source*, So your help means a lot to make this tool stronger and more solid!

---

## 📜 Rules
In order for the code merging process (*Merge*) to run smoothly, please follow these standards:

### 1. Code Quality & Standards
- **Python 3.12.x**: Make sure your code is compatible with the latest version.
- **Passed GitHub Actions**: Before sending a Pull Request (PR), make sure the indicator in your repo is colored. **Green ✅**. Our system will check *Syntax Error* automatically.
- **Clear Variables**: Don't use "ghost" variables. Define all variables. (like `VERSION`) correctly to avoid the `undefined name` error.

### 2. Module Structure & Dependencies
- **Modules Folder**: Save your new module in the `modules/` folder.
- **Requirements**: If your module requires additional libraries, please note them in the `requirements.txt` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Safety & Ethics**: We keep Storm-Framework clean. Inserting malicious code is strictly prohibited. (*malware*), *backdoor*, or scripts that steal user data. We will check each PR manually line by line.
