This is the folder where all types of Cyber ​​Pentest modules are located. These modules are written in the Python programming language because it's the easiest and most popular language. The module categories include Auxiliary, which searches for weaknesses in a system, and Exploit, which exploits vulnerabilities.

There is a template_mod.pyt, this is just a template that you have to use if you want to contribute a module to Cyber ​​Pentest, because this is the standard logic tool for executing a module, without this the module will never be able to be executed even though it can be read.
