## A little explanation about Maps here
in lib is the data content that needs to be loaded by storm because it is important
there are several subfolders with different types and different data such as

**core** == this is the gathering place for the core da.

**smf**  == This is where the cache and build cache are stored.

**ui**   == This is a gathering place for banners that UI needs.

**sqlite** == This is a database file but it is not needed at this time.
