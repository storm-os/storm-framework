This banner is a place to store data that the UI needs.
This can be added with other banners because the UI is loaded randomly.
But make sure the file name uses data1.py, data2.py, differentiate it by number, also make sure the format is .py
otherwise the added banner will never be loaded.

For this core folder, it is currently not being used, the plan is to delete it so there is no trash.
